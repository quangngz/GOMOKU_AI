<h1>GOMOKU AI in C</h1>
 
Gomoku is a board game very famous in my own country (Vietnam), as well as other Asian countries, according to Wikipedia. 
The rule is simple. Given a board with a size of your choice, you and the opponent must connect n consecutive pieces (can be on diagonals or straight lines) with at least one end still open (open here as in the no opponent piece is on the same line).

In this repo, I will utilize the minimax algorithm to make a bot that plays the game. If I have time I may also do alpha beta pruning.
