# 🎮 GOMOKU AI in C

## 🧩 Project Overview
**Intro to Gomoku**<br>
Gomoku (also known as **Cờ Caro**) is a classic strategy board game popular in Vietnam and many other Asian countries. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku), the rules are simple yet deeply strategic:

- The game is played on a grid-based board.
- Two players take turns placing their pieces.
- The objective is to **connect _n_ consecutive pieces** in a row — horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- A valid win must have **at least one open end**, meaning the winning line is not completely blocked by the opponent's pieces on both sides.

**Code idea**<br>
In this repo, I will utilize the minimax algorithm to make a bot that plays the game. For simplicity sake (my mental health's sake) the code only works for game of 8x8 board and win condition of 4.
